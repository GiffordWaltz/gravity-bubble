You are going to build your very own fan website in pure HTML. Later you can choose to add CSS to it.

Pick something that you are a fan of (ie Walking Dead, My Little Pony, etc)

Requirements:

Must have horizontal list of links at the top (at least 3) for page navigation
Must embed a Youtube video of your choosing
Have at least 2 paragraphs of text with nice spacing between paragraphs.
Create a table that shows at least 12 images of your favorite fan topic (grab them from Google). Create a colored border around the outside edge of the table, with no border in-between cells.
Use at least 3 different types of headers
